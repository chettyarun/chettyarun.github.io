		I am responsible for building & scaling the design function. On the Razorpay Payments side, I lead a team of 40+ designers. Our primary focus is making payments simpler for small & medium businesses and enterprises. We're actively building products like <span class="text-link"><a href="https://razorpay.com/flashcheckout/" target="_blank">Flash Checkout</a></span>, <span class="text-link"><a href="https://razorpay.com/payment-links/" target="_blank">Payment Links</a></span>, <span class="text-link"><a href="https://razorpay.com/payments-app/" target="_blank">Payments Mobile App</a></span>, <span class="text-link"><a href="https://razorpay.com/magic/" target="_blank">Magic Checkout</a></span>, etc., to get the next 100 Million businesses in India to adopt digital payments. 
		<br><br>
		On the Razorpay Capital front, I lead a small team of 5 designers. We're focused on solving for the cash flow challenges that small and medium businesses face. We're actively building products like <span class="text-link"><a href="https://razorpay.com/x/corporate-cards/" target="_blank">RazorpayX Corporate Cards</a></span>, <span class="text-link"><a href="https://razorpay.com/capital/instant-settlements/" target="_blank">Instant Settlements</a></span>, <span class="text-link"><a href="https://razorpay.com/capital/cash-advance/" target="_blank">Cash Advance</a></span>

		I also lead a small voluntary team called the Culture Committee. We act as the eyes and ears of the organisation. Actively focusing on how the org culture is evolving as we grow. Ask me about how we setup the culture committee when we meet.
		<br><br>
		Lastly, I think finance is complicated. But, it should be complicated for us and not for our users. I firmly beleive that design plays a huge role in making Finance simple. If you think the same way, we should talk. I am actively hiring for UX Designers, UI Designers, UX Writers, and UX Researchers.
